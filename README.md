# password-generator
Homework 3

This assignment has me create a javascript code for a simple website to generate a useable and able to copy password for the user. I decided to make the selection criteria into a checkable box for user friendly access.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
